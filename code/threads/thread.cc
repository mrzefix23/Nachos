// thread.cc
//      Routines to manage threads.  There are four main operations:
//
//      Start -- create a thread to run a procedure concurrently
//               with the caller (this is done in two steps -- first
//               allocate the Thread object, then call Start on it)
//      Finish -- called when the forked procedure finishes, to clean up
//      Yield -- relinquish control over the CPU to another ready thread
//      Sleep -- relinquish control over the CPU, but thread is now blocked.
//              In other words, it will not run again, until explicitly
//              put back on the ready queue.
